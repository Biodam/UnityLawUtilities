# UnityLawUtilities
A set of useful scripts for Unity that I gathered over the years of unity development. 
This is more of a list of useful things that I always use in my projects.

Take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/wiki) for more info on which assets are already inside the repo. ;D

# UnityLawUtilities
A set of useful scripts for Unity that I use for many projects on Unity. 

## Why?
I began to realize that I was using the same scripts in many projects, but every change or new project, I had to scavange those scripts. Then I thought that would be good to have them all centered somewhere, and then I created this! And I also thought to myself, why not make it open source? 

# What?
There are a lot of scripts here, [attributes](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/tree/master/CustomAttributes), [editor extensions](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/tree/master/Editor), [snippets](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/tree/master/Snippets) of usefull code etc. You can check a list of all of them at the [wiki](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/wiki).

A set of useful scripts for Unity that I gathered over the years of unity development. 
This is more of a list of useful things that I always use in my projects.

## Assets list

Uses an Fade Manager to manage the fade.

### Developed by others
This are scripts that were NOT initially developed by me.

Singleton pattern implemented using unique game objects.
Many modifications were made from the original script (available [here](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Singleton)).

#### Scene History Widget
Supports going backwards and forwards through your recent scene history, as well as a dropdown of all recently edited scenes. Also supports the back/forwards buttons on your mouse! Doesn't support multi-scene editing very well, though.

# Lawendts Unity Utilities
A set of useful scripts for Unity.

## Why?
I began to realize that I was using the same scripts in many projects and wanted to have them in a place where I could easily start to use in all projects.

## What?
There are a lot of scripts here, [attributes](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/tree/master/CustomAttributes), [editor extensions](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/tree/master/Editor), [snippets](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/tree/master/Snippets) of usefull code etc. You can check a list of (almost) all of them at the [wiki](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/wiki).
